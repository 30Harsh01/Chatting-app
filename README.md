# 💬 **Chat App – Real-Time Messaging System**

A lightweight real-time chat application built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.io**.
This project was created so that I and my friends could chat inside our **computer labs**, where mobile phones were not allowed—providing a simple, fun, and fast alternative for communication.

## 🚀 **Why I Built This Project**

Inside our computer labs, we were not allowed to use phones, which made communication difficult during group work or assignments.
To solve this, I built a **web-based real-time chat system** that runs entirely on desktop browsers, allowing us to:

* Talk instantly without mobile phones
* Collaborate during lab sessions
* Enjoy a fast, clean, and user-friendly chat interface

This project became a practical tool for communication and a great hands-on experience with real-time web technologies.
